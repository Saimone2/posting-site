Posting site written in React. The site is implemented using various aspects of React programming. There is authentication, linking between pages using React Router. An unauthenticated user cannot view posts because only the login page is available to him. Information about posts is taken from the site: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/. There are also visual transitions created with the React Transition Group.
